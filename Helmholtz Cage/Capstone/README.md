# Capstone Design Project 2021-2022
## Helmholtz Cage


```markdown 
A Helmholtz cage is a cube structure wrapped by energized wires that create a uniform magnetic field within the structure. 
This magnetic field can be controlled to mimic the magnetic field of the low-Earth orbit space environment. Our final device 
will be used in testing of CubeSats at the Small Satellite Research Lab and will help the lab assess guidance, navigation, 
and control algorithms. The deliverable for this project will be a 2 m3 Helmholtz cage with the ability to test a 6U CubeSat. 
This will include a control system for magnetic field orientation. We also expect to deliver a small-scale prototype of our 
device by the end of this semester.
